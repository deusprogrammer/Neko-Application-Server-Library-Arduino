HTTPHeader library for Arduino v.0.2a

Gotchas
   +Make sure to include these libraries before
      neko.h in your sketch.  This is a temporary
      workaround.
      +SPI.h
      +Ethernet.h

Current limitations:
   +To conserve RAM, the number of query params
      has been reduced to 4.
   +To conserve RAM, the number of web services is
      currently only 3 per verb.  This will change
      when I allow the user to allocate these slots
      however they please.
   +The JSON parsing library has been removed until
      I can find a solution with a smaller 
      footprint.
   +For those with an Arduino Mega or a RAM shield,
      by all means read any JSON parser of your 
      choice, you can collect the PUT or POST 
      data from the point marked in the example 
      HttpArd.

Next Version:
   +I will merge the HTTP reading code into Application Server.
