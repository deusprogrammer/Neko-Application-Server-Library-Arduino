HTTPHeader library for Arduino v.0.1a

Current limitations:
   +To conserve RAM, the number of query params
   has been reduced to 4.
   +The JSON parsing library has been removed until
   I can find a solution with a smaller footprint.
   +For those with an Arduino Mega or a RAM shield,
   by all means readd any JSON parser of your choice,
   you can collect the PUT or POST data from the
   point marked in the example HttpArd.
